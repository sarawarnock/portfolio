            <h3>Hi! I’m Sara and I’m studying to be a full-stack developer through Thinkful’s Engineering program.</h3>
            <p>I am especially interested in applying all of the skills I’ve learned at Thinkful in a job in the environmental sector. 
                I am looking to put my Environmental Studies degree to use, and I believe with the addition of problem solving and software engineering skills, 
                I’ll be able to do just that. 
                When I’m not learning to code, you can find me at the gym (both coaching and working out) or at a live music performance. 
                As a life-long learner, I am constantly looking to challenge myself to acquire new skills. I am currently learning how to play the piano and read music!</p>
